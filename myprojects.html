    <h1>Introduction to Web Technologies</h1>

  <h2>Introduction to Web Services</h2>
  <p>Web services are software applications or components that enable communication and interaction between different systems over the internet.
    They allow various applications to exchange data and functionality regardless of the programming languages, operating systems, or platforms they are built on.
    Web services use standard protocols like HTTP to facilitate communication and are an integral part of modern web development and integration.
  </p>

  <h2>WWW (World Wide Web)</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web, commonly referred to as the web, is a vast network of interconnected documents and resources accessible via the internet.
    It consists of websites, web pages, multimedia content, and other resources linked together through hyperlinks.
  </p>

  <h2>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
  <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content for the World Wide Web.
    It utilizes a system of tags and attributes to define the structure and layout of web pages. Browsers interpret HTML code to render web pages for users.
  </p>

  <h2>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</h2>
  <p>XML is a markup language designed to store and transport data in a structured format.
    It's often used to represent data in a human-readable format that can be easily processed by computers.
    XML is used in various contexts, including configuration files, data interchange, and web services.

      &lt;/food&gt;
      &lt;food&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Strawberry Belgian Waffles&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;price&gt;$7.95&lt;/price&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Light Belgian waffles covered with strawberries and whipped cream&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;calories&gt;900&lt;/calories&gt;
      &lt;/food&gt;
    &lt;/breakfast_menu&gt;
  </pre>

  <h2>Domain Names</h2>
  <p>Domain names are human-readable labels used to identify resources on the internet, such as websites.
    They provide a user-friendly way to access websites instead of using IP addresses.
    Domain names are composed of multiple parts, with the top-level domain (TLD) being the highest level of the hierarchy (e.g., .com, .org, .net, .guru, .online).
  </p>

  <h2>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h2>
  <p>A URL is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet.
    It consists of various components, including the protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), domain name, path, and optional query parameters.
    URLs are used to navigate to specific web pages or resources.
  </p>

  <h2>Website</h2>
  <p>A website is a collection of related web pages, multimedia content, and resources accessible via a common domain name or URL.
    Websites can serve various purposes, including providing information, offering services, conducting e-commerce, and more.
  </p>

  <h2>Web Browser</h2>
  <p>A web browser is software that enables users to access and view web pages on the internet.
    Browsers interpret HTML and other web technologies to display web content, handle navigation, and execute scripts.
    Examples of web browsers include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
  </p>

  <h2>Web Servers</h2>
  <p>Web servers are software applications or hardware devices that store and deliver web content to users' browsers upon request.
    They process incoming requests from clients (browsers) and send back the requested web pages and resources.
  </p>

  <h2>Web Hosting</h2>
  <p>Web hosting is a service that provides individuals and organizations with the resources (such as storage, processing power, and network connectivity) needed to make their websites accessible on the internet.
    Web hosting companies maintain and manage the servers where websites' files and data are stored.
  </p>

  <p>These concepts form the foundation of the World Wide Web and the technologies that power its functionality, enabling communication, information sharing, and online interactions across the globe.</p>
